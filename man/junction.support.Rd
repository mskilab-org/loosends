\arguments{
\item{loose.end.str}{(character)}

\item{reads}{GRanges in SAM / BAM format e.g. output of read.bam or BWA, with fields $qname, $cigar, $flag $seq all populated in standard fashion, and optionally $AS}

\item{junctions}{Junction object}

\item{bwa}{RSeqLib BWA object and path to fasta file corresponding to the reference}

\item{ref}{optional DNAStringSet corresponding to reference genome sequence}

\item{pad}{padding around the junction breakpoint around  which to analyze contig and reference sequences, this should be several standard deviations above the average insert size (2000)}

\item{bx}{logical flag whether data is linked reads, must then have BX flag, and the pad will be set to minimum 1e5}

\item{refseq.pad}{(1e3)}

\item{realign}{flag whether to realign or just use existing alignments}

\item{verbose}{logical flag (TRUE)}

\item{...}{additional parameters to contig support}
}
\value{
reads re-aligned to the reference through the contigs with additional metadata describing features of the alignment
}
\description{
Forked from skitools to allow manual input of reference contig

Takes as input a GRanges of bam alignments (e.g. outputted from bamUtils::read.bam) and a GRanges of rearranged
reference aligned contigs (e.g. output of RSeqLib::BWA) and a set of Junction objects, and outputs reads supporting
these junctions by building a contig around each junction (from the reference) and then running contig.support (see
that functions docuemntation for criteria)
